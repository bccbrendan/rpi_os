You have to #[derive(Debug)] a struct/enum to print it out
with {:?}
Also, need to derive Copy in order to assign it to two different other variables.
(reminder to self, assignment is move by default in rust, and if Copy is derived and it's called for, it'll be used.)
Finally, we need to derive Clone in order to derive Copy in this case.

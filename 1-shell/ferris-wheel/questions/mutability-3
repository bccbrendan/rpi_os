the pattern variable 'string' only lives within the lifetime of the match expr.
Not long enough to be returned.

So we use the 'ref' keyword to make it explicit that the pattern is looking for string references.
(this one took me way too long. need to review the 'ref' keyword and its uses.

ref is similar to &, but can be used in bindings

equivalent:
let ref a = 2;
let a = &2;
(type &i32)

equivalent:
let r = &1
let &a = r;
let a = *r;
(type i32)

a::MyType doesn't seem to have 'foo'. the compiler helps here.
The trait is implemented, but not in scope. need to explicitly use it.

run-pass:
Seconds, Minutes, Milliseconds aren't used.
add use Duraction::Minutes

next, there's no comparison operators defined between the different duration types.
so add one with a big match to handle all the combos of variants.

A bit too length with this one.

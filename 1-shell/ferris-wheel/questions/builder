First we need the 'default' function, associated with Builder

adding assignment methods to 'string' and 'number' methods
get rid of a few compile errors.

then we need to make to_string,
which prints one field if only one field is populated,
else both with a space in the middle.
Using a tuple-match pattern here cut the size 
of the code changes down to the 30 line budget

Needed to play around with the & and ref a lot
in the match case in to_string.

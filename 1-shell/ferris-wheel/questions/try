Ok expects a u16, u32 signature, not Results.
So first, add the '?' postfix to indicate we should return the ErrorA or ErrorB as the return value, if they're seen.
Then the u16 or u32 values will be used for Ok if there's no error.

Next problem is that there's no converter from ErrorA to Error, so implement std::convert::From 
for 'Error' for both of the ErrorA/B variants.

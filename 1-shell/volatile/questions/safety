New takes an unsafe raw pointer and returns a safe *Volatile type.
that's inherrently an unsafe transformation. (we can't magically safely transform unsafe things into safe things)

Read and Write are safe operations at their interfaces
(they're not turning anything unsafe into something 'safe', they don't
deal with unsafe inputs.). But their implementations are unsafe, since
they manipulate raw pointers, which may point to invalid memory.

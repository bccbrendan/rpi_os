readable! adds an impl Trait for Readable for the ReadVolatile, Volatile, and UniqueVolatile structs.
It's nice to use this macro, because the impl trait is nearly identical and repeated 3 times.
It's also error-prone, with all the type contraints, etc.
Finally, it implements the inner function for each of these types.

writable! is very similar, but with different type constraints.

readable_writable! doesn't add any fn definitions, but does contrain types.

Traits allow for code decoupling: a client of a module could rely
only one some traits of that module and have the freedom to use a different
module implementing the same traits.

Unlike inherrited methods, traits can be statically dispatched.
This means less runtime costs, as the compiler has found the concrete function implementation for us already.

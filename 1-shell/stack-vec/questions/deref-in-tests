Tests that fail if deref isn't implemented include:
- assignment_test_example (for use of '*v'
- index_oob (since deref is needed for [0] indexing
- index_oob_after_truncate (same as above)

it seems like pretty much all the tests
rely on Deref, since it impacts the availability of 
'iter' and indexing.

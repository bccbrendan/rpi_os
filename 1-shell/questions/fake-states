If a client picked the wrong starting state, they could
wind up reading from an output pin or driving an input pin.

This would probably appear as a hard-to-find runtime error.
Users might spend time debugging the hardware and circuits.
Possibly this could also damage hardware, but I'm guessing that 
there are protections in place so that writing to an input
doesn't burn out a GPIO.

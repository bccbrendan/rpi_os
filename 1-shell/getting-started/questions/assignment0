In assignment 0, you enabled GPIO pin 16 as an output and then repeatedly set and cleared it by writing 
to registers GPFSEL1, GPSET0, and GPCLR0. 
Which three registers would you write to to do the same for GPIO pin 27? 
Which physical pin on the Raspberry Pi maps to GPIO pin 27?

I'd write to bits 23-21 of the GPIOFSEL2 register to enable the output.
I'd still use GPSET0 and GPCLR0 (bit 27) to set and clear.

It looks like pin 13 maps to GPIO pin 27, according to https://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin13_gpio27#
